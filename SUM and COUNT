# Total world population
# Show the total population of the world.
  SELECT SUM(population) FROM world
 
# List of continents
# List all the continents - just once each.
  select distinct continent from world # distinct 用于返回唯一不同的值
  
# GDP of Africa
# Give the total GDP of Africa
  select sum(gdp) from world
    where continent like 'Africa'
 
# Count the big countries
# How many countries have an area of at least 1000000
  select count(name) from world
    where area >= 1000000
    
# Baltic states population
# What is the total population of ('Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania')
  select sum(population) from world
    where name in ('Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania')
    
# Using GROUP BY and HAVING
# Counting the countries of each continent
# For each continent show the continent and number of countries.
  select continent, count(name) from world
    group by continent
 
# Counting big countries in each continent
# For each continent show the continent and number of countries with populations of at least 10 million.
  select continent,count(name) from world
    where population >= 10000000
    group by continent
    # where 条件查询子句在group by聚合之前作用于table world，且where 子句不支持aggregate functions
# Counting big continents
# List the continents that have a total population of at least 100 million.
  select continent from world
    group by continent
    having sum(population) >= 100000000
    # having 查询子句对group by之后的table起作用，且支持aggregate functions
